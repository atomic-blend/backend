## Complete workflow example

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, dev]
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  backend-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    strategy:
      matrix:
        service: [auth, productivity]
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        
      - name: Build and Test ${{ matrix.service }}
        uses: ./.github/actions/build-and-test
        with:
          working-directory: ./${{ matrix.service }}
          maizzle-directory: ./${{ matrix.service }}/maizzle
          codecov-token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
        
      - name: Use outputs
        run: |
          echo "Coverage file: ${{ steps.build-test.outputs.coverage-file }}"
          echo "Binary path: ${{ steps.build-test.outputs.binary-path }}"
```

## Prerequisites

- The project must contain a `go.mod` file in the working directory
- The Maizzle directory must contain a `package.json` with a `build` script
- Go tests must be present in the project

## Generated Artifacts

- **coverage-report**: HTML coverage report
- **backend-binary**: Compiled application binary

## Notes

- The action uses Go modules and automatically caches them
- Node.js also caches npm dependencies
- Code coverage is uploaded to Codecov only if a token is provided
- Artifacts are uploaded only if `upload-artifacts` is set to `true`
