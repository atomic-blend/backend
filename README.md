# 🌟 Atomic Blend

Welcome to **Atomic Blend** – the open-source, end-to-end encrypted everything app that seamlessly integrates your **work, personal life, and productivity** into one secure and unified space. I've fallen for the concept of everything app like ClickUp does but I am struggling with the fact to give all my life to a company without any form of end-to-end encryption.

## 🚀 What is Atomic Blend?
Atomic Blend is your **personal and professional hub**, combining task management, note-taking, collaboration, and encrypted data storage into one simple yet powerful platform.

- 🔒 **Privacy First** – End-to-end encryption ensures your data remains yours.
- 📋 **All-in-One** – Manage tasks, notes, calendar, and team collaboration in one place.
- ⚡ **Open Source** – Built for the community, by the community.
- 🔗 **Seamless Integration** – Sync across all your devices, with APIs for extensibility.
- 🌍 **Work & Life Harmony** – Whether it’s projects, groceries, or ideas, keep everything organized.

## 💡 Why "Atomic Blend"?
The name **Atomic Blend** is inspired by the book *Atomic Habits* by James Clear, which illustrates the power of small and actionable steps to improve any aspect of your life. This, combined with the **blending** of all your content into a single, seamless experience, makes Atomic Blend the perfect tool to **organize, relieve stress, and boost productivity**—all while maintaining **privacy** and security.

## 🔄 Project Status

🚧 Current State: Atomic Blend is in the Proof of Concept (PoC) stage, focusing on task management with encryption.
🔐 Encryption: Everything in the system has the potential to be fully encrypted. Currently, tasks are encrypted, and the encryption model is being expanded.
💾 Backend Role: The backend will evolve into a real-time storage engine for syncing and collaboration, ensuring data security without direct access to user content.
🔄 Upcoming Improvements: The encryption approach requires some rewrites, transitioning from RSA to Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) to be quantum-resistant.
